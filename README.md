# Abstract
The field of neuroscience is experiencing rapid growth in the complexity and quantity of the recorded neural activity allowing us unprecedented access to its dynamics in different brain areas. The objective of this work is to discover directly from the experimental data rich and comprehensible models for brain function that will be concurrently robust to noise. Considering this task from the perspective of dimensionality reduction, we develop an innovative, robust to noise dictionary learning framework based on adversarial training methods for the identification of patterns of synchronous firing activity as well as within a time lag. We employ real-world binary datasets describing the spontaneous neuronal activity of laboratory mice over time, and we aim to their efficient low-dimensional representation. The results on the classification accuracy for the discrimination between the clean and the adversarial-noisy activation patterns obtained by an SVM classifier highlight the efficacy of the proposed scheme compared to other methods, and the visualization of the dictionaryâ€™s distribution demonstrates the multifarious information that we obtain from it.

# Requirements
